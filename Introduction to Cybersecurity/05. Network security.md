## Cyber kill chain 
There are 7 steps to follow when preparing to break into a target network

1. Recon = Learn as much as possible about the target such as the type of servers, operating system, IP address, username, email address used.
2. Weaponization = Process of preparing a file with malicious component
3. Delivery = delivery of weaponized file to the target
4. Exploitation = When the user opens the malicious file, the system executes the malicious component.
5. Installation = Install the malware on the target system
6. Command and control = Successful installation of malware provides the attacker with the ability to control the target's system
7. Actions and objectives = Exploitation of target's information

## Practical linux commands
- pwd (print working directory) = see where we are in the linux system
- cd = change directory
- get = download the particular file
- ssh root@ip address = login root account
