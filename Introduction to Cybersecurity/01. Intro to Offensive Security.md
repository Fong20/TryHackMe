Offensive security is the **process of breaking into computer systems, exploiting software bugs, and finding loopholes in applications to gain unauthorized access to them.**

## Hacking first machine using GoBuster Terminal
**Task:**  Hack a fake bank application called FakeBank by using the Gobuster terminal application.

Gobuster is a command-line application which is used to brute-force FakeBank's website to find hidden directories and pages. GoBuster will take a list of potential page or directory names and tries accessing a website with each of them; if the page exists, it tells you.

The following command is typed into the terminal to find potentially hidden pages on FakeBank's website using GoBuster (a command-line security application).

**gobuster -u http://fakebank.com -w wordlist.txt dir**

- **-u** command is used to state the website which we are scanning
- **-w** command takes a list of words to iterate through to find hidden pages.
