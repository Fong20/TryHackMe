# 02.Intro to Defensive Security

## Introduction
While **offensive security (red teaming/penetration testing) focuses on breaking into systems by exploiting system weaknesses**, **defensive security (blue teaming) focuses on defending systems from cyberattacks by preventing intrutions from happening, detecting intrutions and responding properly.**

## Areas of defensive security
- Security Operations Center (SOC)
- Threat Intelligence
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response
- Malware Analysis

### Security Operations Center (SOC)
A SOC is a **team of cybersecurity professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cybersecurity threats.**

**Main areas of interest for SOC:**
- vulnerabilities
- policy violations
- unauthorized activities
- network intrusions

### Threat Intelligence
- Threat intelligence is the **process of obtaining information of threats to help companies better prepare against potential adversaries.** Learning about adversaries allows one to know the tactics, techniques and procedures used and consequently prepare a response strategy to mitigate future attacks.
- Data can be collected from **sources such as network logs and public sources such as forums.**

### Digital Forensics and Incident Response
**Digital forensics analyzes evidence of an attack and its perpetrators and other areas such as intellectual property theft, cyber espionage, and possession of unauthorized content.**

**Digital forensics focus on different areas such as:**
- file system
- system memory
- system logs = log files which provides information of what happened to the system
- network logs = logs of network packets that travels in the network

Incident Response **specifies the methodology to handle incidents in order to reduce the damage done and recover in the shortest time possible.**

**Four major phases of incident response process:**
- preperation = Measures which are implemented to prevent incidents from happening in the first place.
- detection and analysis = Have the necessary resources to detect any incident
- containment, eradication and recovery = Process of stopping the incident from affecting other systems.
- post-incident activity = Documenting the lessons learned to prevent the similar incidents from occuring in the future.

### Malware analysis
Malware **stands for Malicious software**

**Types of malware:**
- virus
- trojan horse
- ransomware

**2 ways of analysing malware:**
- static analysis = Inspecting the malicious program without running it
- dynamic analysis = Run the malicious program in a controlled environment and inspect the workings and behavior.
