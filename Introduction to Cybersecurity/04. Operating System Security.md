# 04.Operating System Security

## 3 important aspects of security:
- confidentiality = Files and information are only available to intended persons.
- Integrity = No one can tamper with the files stored on the system or while being transferred on the network.
- Availability = Device (smartphone/laptop) nust be available to use anytime

## Common examples of OS Security
- Authentication and weak passwords
- weak file permissions
- access to malicious programs. Malicious programs such as trojan horses affect confidentiality and integrity whereas ransomware affects availability.

**Practical Linux terminal commands**
- ssh username@ip address = used to login the
- whoami = shows which account we are logged into
- ls = displays all the files in the current directory
- cat filename = print the contents of the file on the terminal
