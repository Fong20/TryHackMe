# 07.Security Operations

## Introduction
SOC is a team of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring a company's network and systems 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

## Purpose of monitoring:
- find vulnerabilities on the network
- detect unauthorized activity
- discover policy violations
- detect intrusions
- support with incident response\

## Data sources used by SOC
- server logs
- DNS actvity
- Firewall logs
- DHCP logs

## SOC services
SOC services include **reactive and proactive services.**

Reactive services refer to the tasks initialized after detecting an intrusion or malicious event. Examples of reactive services include:
- monitor security posture = monitoring the network and computers for security alerts
- vulnerability management
- malware analysis
- intrusion detection
- reporting

Proactive services refer to the tasks handled by the SOC without any indicator of an intrusion. Examples of proactive services include:
- network security monitoring (NSM) = monitoring network data nd traffic to detect signs of intrusion.
- threat hunting = assume that intrusion has taken place and begins to hunt to confirm the assumption
- threat intelligence = learn about the potential adversaries and their tactics to improve the company's defences

## Practical example of SOC
In this practical, we are using a firewall to stop an ongoing attack. A firewall is a device that inspects network packet entering or leaving a network or a system

Most basic types of firewalls inspect
- source and destination IP address
- source and destination port numbers

Eg:
- source address = 172.10.4.1
- destination address 10.10.10.41
- port number = 80
- action = PASS

Therefore, all ip packets from source 172.10.4.1 to destination 10.10.10.41 through port number 80 will be allowed.

- source address = 172.10.4.1
- destination address 10.10.10.41
- port number = 80
- action = DROP

Therefore, all ip packets from source 172.10.4.1 to destination 10.10.10.41 through port number 80 will be blocked.
