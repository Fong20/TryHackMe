# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) - Notes

## 1. What is SIEM?
SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a tool that:
- Collects data from various network devices and endpoints.
- Stores logs centrally for analysis.
- Correlates events for security monitoring and incident response.

---

## 2. Why is SIEM Needed?
SIEM provides:
- **Network visibility**: Better insight into network activities.
- **Real-time threat detection**: Alerts on suspicious activity.
- **Incident investigation**: Allows security teams to analyze past events.

---

## 3. Types of Log Sources

### Host-Centric Log Sources
Logs that capture events related to individual hosts, e.g.:
- **Windows Event Logs**
- **Sysmon Logs**
- **Osquery Logs**
- **Example Activities**:
  - User accessing a file.
  - Process execution.
  - PowerShell execution.

### Network-Centric Log Sources
Logs generated when network communication occurs, e.g.:
- **SSH, VPN, HTTP/s, FTP Logs**
- **Example Activities**:
  - SSH connection attempts.
  - File accessed via FTP.
  - Web traffic analysis.

---

## 4. Importance of SIEM
SIEM helps by:
- **Centralizing log collection & analysis**
- **Correlating logs for threat detection**
- **Providing real-time alerts & monitoring**
- **Generating data insights & visualizations**
- **Investigating past incidents efficiently**

---

## 5. Log Ingestion Methods in SIEM
Different ways logs are ingested into SIEM:
1. **Agent / Forwarder**: Installed on endpoints to collect logs (e.g., Splunk Forwarder).
2. **Syslog**: Standardized protocol for log collection.
3. **Manual Upload**: Offline data ingestion for analysis.
4. **Port-Forwarding**: Endpoints send logs to SIEM via designated ports.

---

## 6. SIEM Capabilities
SIEM provides:
- **Event correlation across log sources.**
- **Host and network activity visibility.**
- **Threat hunting & investigation tools.**
- **Alerting and security incident response.**

---

## 7. SOC Analyst Responsibilities
SOC Analysts use SIEM to:
- Monitor and investigate security alerts.
- Identify and reduce false positives.
- Tune SIEM rules for better accuracy.
- Ensure compliance and reporting.

---

## 8. SIEM Dashboards
Dashboards present log data in visual formats with key insights such as:
- **Alert highlights**
- **System notifications**
- **Failed login attempts**
- **Rules triggered**
- **Top domains visited**

---

## 9. Correlation Rules in SIEM
SIEM uses logical expressions to detect threats, e.g.:
- **Multiple failed login attempts → Alert for brute force attack.**
- **USB plugged in → Alert if USB is restricted.**
- **Large outbound traffic → Alert for potential data exfiltration.**

### Example Correlation Rules
#### Rule 1: Event Log Cleared Detection
**Condition:**  
If **Log Source = WinEventLog** AND **EventID = 104** → Trigger alert for **Event Log Cleared**.

#### Rule 2: Suspicious Command Execution Detection
**Condition:**  
If **Log Source = WinEventLog** AND **EventID = 4688** AND **NewProcessName = "whoami"** → Trigger alert for **WHOAMI Execution Detected**.

---

## 10. Alert Investigation Process
Once an alert is triggered:
1. **Analyst reviews the alert on the dashboard.**
2. **Events and logs are examined to check for false positives.**
3. **Response actions are taken based on findings:**
   - False alarm → Rule tuning needed.
   - True positive → Further investigation required.
   - If confirmed malicious:
     - **Isolate affected system**
     - **Block suspicious IP addresses**
