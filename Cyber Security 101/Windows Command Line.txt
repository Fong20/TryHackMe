# Introduction to Command Line Interface (CLI)

## GUI vs CLI
- **GUIs** are intuitive and user-friendly.
- **CLIs** have a learning curve but offer faster and more efficient operations once mastered.

### Advantages of CLI
1. **Lower Resource Usage**: Ideal for older hardware or systems with limited resources.
2. **Automation**: Scripts or batch files simplify repetitive tasks.
3. **Remote Management**: CLI supports SSH, working well on low-resource systems and slow networks.
