# Vulnerability Scanning and Patching

## Introduction
Imagine you live in a small house, and one day you notice small holes in the roof. If left untreated, they could cause major issues, such as water damage, dust entry, or insect infestation. These small holes are similar to **vulnerabilities** in digital devices—weaknesses in software or hardware that attackers can exploit.

To fix the holes, you repair the roof—this process is called **patching**. In the digital world, vulnerabilities are patched by applying fixes to software or systems.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand vulnerability scanning and its types.
- Learn about tools used for vulnerability scanning.
- Demonstrate the OpenVAS vulnerability scanner.
- Conduct a practical vulnerability scanning exercise.

## What is Vulnerability Scanning?
Vulnerability scanning is the process of inspecting digital systems to find weaknesses. Organizations store critical information in digital infrastructures and must scan systems regularly to prevent attacks. Many security standards mandate vulnerability scans, either quarterly or annually.

### Automated vs. Manual Scanning
Manual scanning is time-consuming and may miss major vulnerabilities. Automated scanners simplify the process by scanning IP addresses and networks, generating detailed reports on discovered vulnerabilities.

## Types of Vulnerability Scanning

### **Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated Scans**

| Authenticated Scans | Unauthenticated Scans |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Requires host credentials. | No credentials needed, only an IP address. |
| Identifies vulnerabilities accessible by an internal user. | Identifies vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker. |
| Provides deeper insight into system configurations and installed applications. | Easier to set up and less resource-intensive. |
| Example: Scanning an internal database with credentials. | Example: Scanning a public-facing website for vulnerabilities. |

### **Internal vs. External Scans**

| Internal Scans | External Scans |
|---------------|--------------|
| Conducted from inside the network. | Conducted from outside the network. |
| Identifies vulnerabilities attackers can exploit after gaining network access. | Identifies vulnerabilities exposed to external attackers. |

### **Choosing the Right Scan Type**
Authenticated scans are typically used for internal assessments, while unauthenticated scans are often performed externally.

## Popular Vulnerability Scanners

### **Nessus**
- Developed in 1998 as an open-source project, later acquired by Tenable.
- Available in both free and paid versions.
- Requires on-premises deployment.

### **Qualys**
- Cloud-based subscription model.
- Provides continuous monitoring and alerts.
- No need for on-premises management.

### **Nexpose**
- Developed by Rapid7 in 2005.
- Offers asset discovery, vulnerability scoring, and compliance checks.
- Supports on-premises and hybrid deployments.

### **OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System)**
- Open-source scanner developed by Greenbone Security.
- Identifies known vulnerabilities using a database.
- Suitable for small organizations and individuals.

## CVE and CVSS: Tracking and Scoring Vulnerabilities

### **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**
- Unique identifier for vulnerabilities, managed by MITRE Corporation.
- CVE format: `CVE-Year-XXXX` (e.g., `CVE-2024-9374`).
- Used to track and reference vulnerabilities.

### **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**
- Assigns severity scores (0-10) based on impact and exploitability.

| CVSS Score | Severity Level |
|------------|---------------|
| 0.0-3.9    | Low |
| 4.0-6.9    | Medium |
| 7.0-8.9    | High |
| 9.0-10     | Critical |

## OpenVAS: Installation and Usage

### **Installation on Ubuntu (via Docker)**
```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo docker run -d -p 443:443 --name openvas mikesplain/openvas
```
### **Accessing OpenVAS Web Interface**
- Open a browser and go to: `https://127.0.0.1`
- Log in to access the OpenVAS dashboard.

### **Performing a Vulnerability Scan**
1. Navigate to **Scans > Tasks**.
2. Click the **star icon** → **New Task**.
3. Enter task details and scan target (IP address).
4. Select a scan type and click **Create**.
5. Start the scan by clicking the **Play button** in the "Actions" menu.
6. After completion, check the scan status and view discovered vulnerabilities.

### **Exporting Reports**
- OpenVAS allows exporting scan results in different formats for analysis and reporting.

## Conclusion
Vulnerability scanning is essential for securing digital assets. Tools like Nessus, Qualys, Nexpose, and OpenVAS help automate scanning, making it efficient and effective. CVE and CVSS provide standardized methods for tracking and prioritizing vulnerabilities, ensuring organizations can mitigate risks proactively.
