## Defensive Security

### Key Objectives
1. **Preventing intrusions** – Stopping attacks before they happen.
2. **Detecting and responding** – Identifying intrusions and mitigating them.

### Blue Team Responsibilities
- **User Cyber Security Awareness** – Training users to recognize threats.
- **Asset Documentation & Management** – Keeping track of protected systems.
- **Updating & Patching Systems** – Closing security gaps with updates.
- **Preventative Security Devices** – Firewalls & Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).
- **Logging & Monitoring** – Detecting unauthorized activity.

## Security Operations Center (SOC)

### Role of a SOC
- **Monitor networks & systems** to detect malicious activity.
- **Respond to threats** before they cause significant damage.

### Areas of Interest
1. **Vulnerabilities** – Patching known weaknesses.
2. **Policy Violations** – Enforcing security policies.
3. **Unauthorized Activity** – Detecting stolen credentials or abnormal behavior.
4. **Network Intrusions** – Identifying malicious access attempts.

### Threat Intelligence
- **Collecting & Analyzing Data** about potential adversaries.
- **Understanding Attackers' Tactics** to predict and mitigate threats.
- **Types of Adversaries**:
  - Nation-state actors (political motivations)
  - Ransomware groups (financial motivations)

## Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

### Digital Forensics
- **Investigating cyber crimes** using digital evidence.
- **Key Forensic Areas**:
  1. **File System Analysis** – Recovering files, detecting anomalies.
  2. **System Memory Analysis** – Investigating in-memory attacks.
  3. **System Logs** – Analyzing event logs for traces of an attack.
  4. **Network Logs** – Reviewing network activity for attack indicators.

### Incident Response (IR)
- **Phases of IR**:
  1. **Preparation** – Training teams & implementing security measures.
  2. **Detection & Analysis** – Identifying incidents & assessing severity.
  3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery** – Stopping the attack & restoring systems.
  4. **Post-Incident Activity** – Documenting lessons learned.

## Malware Analysis
- **Understanding malicious software** and its impact.

### Types of Malware
- **Virus** – Attaches to files and spreads.
- **Trojan Horse** – Disguises itself as legitimate software.
- **Ransomware** – Encrypts files & demands payment for decryption.

### Analysis Techniques
- **Static Analysis** – Examining malware without execution.
- **Dynamic Analysis** – Running malware in a controlled environment.

## SOC Analyst Role
- **Investigating Alerts in a SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management).
- **Differentiating Between Threats & False Positives**:
  - Multiple failed login attempts (user vs. attacker).
  - Connections from unknown IPs (benign vs. unauthorized access).
