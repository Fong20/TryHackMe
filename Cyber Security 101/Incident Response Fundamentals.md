# Incident Response Fundamentals

## Introduction
- Just like securing a home with guards and CCTV cameras, digital assets need protection.
- Cyber security incidents involve unauthorized access, attacks, or breaches causing financial or reputational damage.

## Incident Response
- Incident response handles security incidents from detection to resolution.
- Security solutions generate logs to monitor abnormal activities.
- Alerts are classified into:
  - **False Positives:** Raised alerts that are not actual threats.
  - **True Positives:** Genuine threats requiring action.

## Incident Severity Levels
- **Low, Medium, High, Critical** – prioritization based on potential damage.
- Example: A phishing email could be critical for an organization dependent on sensitive communication.

## Types of Cyber Security Incidents
1. **Malware Infections** – Malicious programs causing damage.
2. **Security Breaches** – Unauthorized access to confidential data.
3. **Data Leaks** – Exposure of confidential data (intentional or accidental).
4. **Insider Attacks** – Employees or insiders compromising security.
5. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks** – Flooding systems to make them unavailable.

## Incident Response Frameworks
### **SANS Framework (PICERL)**
1. **Preparation** – Setting up security teams, tools, and training.
2. **Identification** – Monitoring and detecting abnormal activity.
3. **Containment** – Isolating infected systems to prevent spread.
4. **Eradication** – Removing the threat (e.g., malware removal).
5. **Recovery** – Restoring systems from backups.
6. **Lessons Learned** – Reviewing and improving security strategies.

### **NIST Framework**
- Similar to SANS but with four phases: **Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment & Eradication, Recovery & Lessons Learned**.

## Security Solutions
- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):** Centralized log monitoring for identifying incidents.
- **AV (Antivirus):** Detects and removes known malware.
- **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response):** Protects individual systems from advanced threats.

## Incident Response Plan (IRP)
- A formal document outlining procedures before, during, and after an incident.
- Includes:
  - Roles & responsibilities
  - Incident response methodology
  - Communication & escalation plans

## Playbooks & Runbooks
- **Playbooks:** High-level guidelines for responding to incidents.
- **Runbooks:** Detailed step-by-step instructions for handling specific incidents.

### Example Playbook: **Phishing Email**
1. Notify stakeholders.
2. Analyze email headers and attachments.
3. Check if anyone opened the attachment.
4. Isolate infected systems.
5. Block the sender.

## Conclusion
- Cyber security incident response is crucial to mitigate threats.
- Organizations adopt frameworks and security solutions to strengthen defenses.
