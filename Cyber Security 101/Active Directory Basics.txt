# Active Directory Basics

## Overview
- A **Windows domain** allows centralised management of users, computers, and resources in a network.
- Key component: **Active Directory (AD)** hosted on a **Domain Controller (DC)**.

## Key Concepts

### Advantages of Windows Domains:
1. **Centralised Identity Management**:
   - Manage user accounts centrally via AD.
2. **Security Policy Management**:
   - Apply uniform security policies across users and devices.

## Active Directory Objects

### Users:
- **Types**:
  - **People**: Represent employees.
  - **Services**: Minimal privilege accounts for running services.
- Security Principals: Authenticated and assigned privileges in the domain.

### Machines:
- Each computer in a domain has a **machine account**.
  - Format: `MachineName$`.
  - Local administrator rights on its own device.
  - Passwords are 120-character random and auto-rotated.

### Security Groups:
- Allow grouped access to resources.
- Users/machines inherit privileges from their group memberships.
- Common default groups:
  - **Domain Admins**: Full domain control.
  - **Backup Operators**: Can bypass file permissions.
  - **Domain Users/Computers**: All users/computers in the domain.

### Organizational Units (OUs):
- Container objects to organise users/machines.
  - Reflect organisational structure for applying policies.
  - Users can belong to only one OU.

## Authentication Protocols

### Kerberos:
- Default protocol for recent Windows domains.
- Process:
  1. User requests a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** from the Key Distribution Center (KDC).
  2. Use TGT to request **Ticket Granting Service (TGS)** for specific resources.
  3. Present TGS to the target service for access.
- Advantages:
  - Avoids transmitting passwords across the network.

### NetNTLM:
- Legacy protocol using challenge-response mechanism.
- Steps:
  1. Server sends a challenge.
  2. Client responds using NTLM hash and challenge data.
  3. Verification occurs at the DC.

## Advanced Domain Configurations

### Trees:
- A hierarchy of domains sharing the same namespace.
- Example:
  - Root: `thm.local`.
  - Subdomains: `uk.thm.local`, `us.thm.local`.
- Benefits:
  - Segmentation of resources and policies by regions or branches.
  - Independent administration of subdomains.

### Forests:
- Combination of domain trees with different namespaces.
- Example:
  - Tree 1: `thm.local`.
  - Tree 2: `mht.local`.
- Joined by **trust relationships**.

---

## Trust Relationships
- Enable cross-domain resource access.
- Types:
  1. **One-Way Trust**:
     - Domain A trusts B: Users in B can access resources in A.
  2. **Two-Way Trust**:
     - Mutual access between domains.
- Trust does not grant automatic access; permissions still need to be defined.

## Tools

### Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC):
- Interface for managing:
  - Users.
  - Groups.
  - OUs.
  - Computers.
- Allows creation, modification, and password resets.
