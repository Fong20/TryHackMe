## System Configuration Utility (MSConfig)
The **System Configuration utility** is an advanced troubleshooting tool used to diagnose startup issues. It requires **local administrator rights** to access.

### Launching MSConfig
- Can be opened from the **Start Menu**.

### Tabs Overview
The utility has five tabs:
1. **General**: Select which devices and services load on boot (Normal, Diagnostic, or Selective startup).
2. **Boot**: Configure various operating system boot options.
3. **Services**: Lists all services (running or stopped) and allows management.
4. **Startup**: Redirects to Task Manager to manage startup items.
5. **Tools**: Launches various system utilities with descriptions for each.
