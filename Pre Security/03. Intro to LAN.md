# 03. Intro to LAN

## LAN topologies
Refers to the design of the network and how the devices are connected.

### Star topology
The main premise of a star topology is that devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub. This topology is the most commonly found today due to its reliability and scalability despite the cost.

  ### Advantages
  Scalable = it is very easy to add more devices as the demand for the network increases.

  ### Disadvantages
  - Cost = Because more cabling and the purchase of dedicated networking equipment is required for this topology, it is more expensive than any of the other topologies.
  - Prone to failure = If the centralised hardware that connects devices fails, these devices will no longer be able to send or receive data. Thankfully, these centralised hardware devices are often robust.

### Bus topology
Bus topology connection relies upon a single connection which is known as a backbone cable. This type of topology is similar to the leaf off of a tree in the sense that devices (leaves) stem from where the branches are on this cable.

  ### Advantages
  Cost efficient and easier to setup

  ### Disadvantages
  - Performance = Because all data destined for each device travels along the same cable, it is very quickly prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously requesting data.
  - Prone to failure = A single point of failure along the backbone cable. If this cable were to break, devices can no longer receive or transmit data along the bus.
  - 
### Ring topology
- In a ring topology, devices such as computers are connected directly to each other to form a loop, meaning that there is little cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology.
- A ring topology works by sending data across the loop until it reaches the destined device, using other devices along the loop to forward the data.

  ### Advantages
  Easier to troubleshoot as data only travels in one direction

  ### Disadvantages
  -  Less efficient =  Data has to travel through many multiple devices first before reaching the intended device.
  - Prone to failure =  A fault such as cut cable, or broken device will result in the entire networking breaking.

## Subnetting
Subnetting is the process of splitting up a network into smaller, miniature networks within itself.

Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways:
- Identify the network address
- Identify the host address
- Identify the default gateway

### Benefits of subnetting
- Efficiency
- Security
- Full control

## ARP protocol
- Address resolution protocol is a layer 2 OSI protocol which is used to find the destination MAC address. This is done by mapping its IP address to its MAC address.
- Whenever the source device wants to transfer data but does not have the destination MAC address, it will send out a broadcast ARP request which determines if the destination's device IP address matches. If the destination device does have the requested IP address, an ARP reply which contains the MAC address is returned to the initial device to acknowledge this. The destination MAC address is then saved in the source device's ARP cache.

## DHCP
Dynamic host control protocol is  a layer 7 OSI protocol (application layer) which its main function is to provide IPV4 and IPV6 addresses to end devices dynamically.

  ### DHCP process
  - When a device connects to a network, if it has not already been manually assigned an IP address, it sends out a request (DHCP Discover) to see if any DHCP servers are on the network.
  - The DHCP server then replies back with an IP address the device could use (DHCP Offer).
  - The device then sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP Address (DHCP Request).
  - The DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging this has been completed, and the device can start using the IP Address (DHCP ACK).
