# 03. Intro to LAN

## LAN topologies
Refers to the design of the network and how the devices are connected.

### Star topology
The main premise of a star topology is that devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub. This topology is the most commonly found today due to its reliability and scalability despite the cost.

  ### Advantages
  Scalable = it is very easy to add more devices as the demand for the network increases.

  ### Disadvantages
  - Cost = Because more cabling and the purchase of dedicated networking equipment is required for this topology, it is more expensive than any of the other topologies.
  - Prone to failure = If the centralised hardware that connects devices fails, these devices will no longer be able to send or receive data. Thankfully, these centralised hardware devices are often robust.

### Bus topology
Bus topology connection relies upon a single connection which is known as a backbone cable. This type of topology is similar to the leaf off of a tree in the sense that devices (leaves) stem from where the branches are on this cable.

  ### Advantages
  Cost efficient and easier to setup

  ### Disadvantages
  - Performance = Because all data destined for each device travels along the same cable, it is very quickly prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously requesting data.
  - Prone to failure = A single point of failure along the backbone cable. If this cable were to break, devices can no longer receive or transmit data along the bus.

### Ring topology
- In a ring topology, devices such as computers are connected directly to each other to form a loop, meaning that there is little cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology.
- A ring topology works by sending data across the loop until it reaches the destined device, using other devices along the loop to forward the data.

  ### Advantages
  Easier to troubleshoot as data only travels in one direction

  ### Disadvantages
  -  Less efficient =  Data has to travel through many multiple devices first before reaching the intended device.
  - Prone to failure =  A fault such as cut cable, or broken device will result in the entire networking breaking.

## Subnetting
Subnetting is the process of splitting up a network into smaller, miniature networks within itself.

Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways:
- Identify the network address
- Identify the host address
- Identify the default gateway

### Benefits of subnetting
- Efficiency
- Security
- Full control
