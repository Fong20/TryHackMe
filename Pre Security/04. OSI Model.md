# OSI Model Overview

The **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)** is a foundational framework used in networking. It defines how devices send, receive, and interpret data in a uniform manner, allowing devices with different functions and designs to communicate effectively.

## Key Concepts
- **Encapsulation**: Data gains specific pieces of information as it travels through each layer.
- **Seven Layers**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities, arranged from Layer 7 (Application) to Layer 1 (Physical).

## OSI Model Layers

### Layer 1: Physical Layer
- Focuses on hardware components used in networking.
- Data transfer occurs via electrical signals in binary form (1's and 0's).
- Examples: Ethernet cables and physical connections.

### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
- Responsible for **physical addressing** and formatting data for transmission.
- Utilizes **MAC addresses** to identify endpoints.
  - MAC addresses are unique, set by the manufacturer, and can be spoofed.
- Includes **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**.
- Prepares data for physical transmission.

### Layer 3: Network Layer
- Handles **routing** and reassembly of data packets.
- Determines the optimal path based on:
  - Shortest path.
  - Reliability of the route.
  - Speed of the physical connection (e.g., copper vs. fiber).
- Utilizes **IP addresses** for addressing.
- Layer 3 devices: Routers.

### Layer 4: Transport Layer
- Manages data transmission using **TCP** or **UDP** protocols.

#### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Ensures reliable, accurate data transfer.
- Features:
  - Error checking and synchronization.
  - Reliable but slower due to extensive processing.
- Use cases: File sharing, email, and web browsing.

#### UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Prioritizes speed over reliability.
- Features:
  - No error checking or synchronization.
  - Flexible for developers but may lose data.
- Use cases: Video streaming and device discovery (e.g., ARP, DHCP).

### Layer 5: Session Layer
- Establishes and maintains connections between devices.
- Manages sessions by:
  - Closing inactive sessions.
  - Using checkpoints to optimize data retransmission.
- Ensures data stays within its session.

### Layer 6: Presentation Layer
- Standardizes data formats for interoperability between different software.
- Handles data encryption (e.g., HTTPS).
- Acts as a translator for the application layer.

### Layer 7: Application Layer
- The layer closest to the user, providing a GUI to interact with data.
- Implements protocols like **DNS** for domain-to-IP translation.
- Examples: Email clients, browsers, and file transfer tools.

## Protocol Highlights
- **TCP vs UDP**: Reliability vs speed.
- **Security**: Encryption occurs at the presentation layer.
- **Application Layer Protocols**: Examples include DNS and HTTPS.
