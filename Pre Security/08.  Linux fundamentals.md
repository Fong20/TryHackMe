# 08. Linux Fundamentals
directory is also known as a folder

Shortcuts
ctrl L = clear the terminal

## Basic commands
1. echo = Output any text that we provide
2. whoami = Find out what user we're currently logged in as!

## Basic commands to interact with file systems
1. ls = list the files in the current directory
2. cd = change directory
3. cat = output the contents of the file
4. pwd (present working directory) = displays the current directory we are in

## Searching for files / Searching specific contents in the file

  ### find 
  The find command is used to search for specific files in the directory

  **Syntax:**
  
  find -name filename.txt

  **Example 1:**

  **Example 2: **
  
  Using wildcard (*) to find all files with the .txt extension

  ### grep
  The grep command allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for.

  **Syntax:**
  grep "content which we want to find" file name

  **Example:**

  ### Redirection
  redirection operator (>) is used to redirect the output to other location

  **Example:**

  The following code takes the output of printing hey and place it into a file name welcome. If the file is not found in the directory, it will create the file.

  **Example:**

  (>>) is another redirection operator. However, it does not overwrite the contents in the file. It just adds the output at the end.

  ## Flags and switches
  Flags and switches are used to extend the behaviour of commands. The commands usually have additional arguments which perform additional behaviour. These arguments are identified by a hyphen - and followed by the flag/switch keyword.

  Example:
  
  ls -a lists all the available files/folders which includes hidden files/folders

  ### Copying and moving files/folders
  - To copy contents of a file to another file, use the command cp followed by the name of the existing file and the name of the new file which we wish to assign the contents to. Do note that all the contents will be copied.
  - To move a file to a new folder, use the mv command.
  - We can also use the mv command to rename a file or folder.

  ### Determining file type
  To determine the file type, we can use the command file followed by the name of the file

## Common linux directories
- /etc : root directory which stores all the important system files which are used by the OS
- /var : stores data which are frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on ths system
- /var/log : provides log files from running services and applications
- /tmp : volatile root directory which stores data temporarily. The data stored here will be wiped once the computer is restarted
- /root : Home directory of the root user

## Terminal text editiors
There are two types of text editors:
1. Nano
2. VIM

### Nano
- To create / edit a file using nano text editor, type nano followed by the file's name
- Once information has been provided / edited in the file, remember to save the changes by using ctrl-x

## General useful utilities

### Downloading files
Use wget command to downlaod files from the web via HTTP to the directory. This can be done by typing wget followed by the address if the resource that we wish to download.

### Transfering files from host using secure copy (SCP)
Secure copy can be used to copy files and directories from current system to remote system / remote system to current system

Example:

### Serving files from host using built in Python 3 support
- Ubuntu machines come pre-packaged with Python 3 and Python provides a lightweight solution called HTTPServer which converts the local machine into a quick web server to download your own files.
- The downloaded files will be stored in the directory which is used to run the command.
- To do this, type python3 -m http.server to connect to the server and use the command wget followed by the computer's ip address and name of the file to download the file
