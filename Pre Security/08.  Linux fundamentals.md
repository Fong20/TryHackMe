# 08. Linux Fundamentals Part 1
directory is also known as a folder

Shortcuts
ctrl L = clear the terminal

## Basic commands
1. echo = Output any text that we provide
2. whoami = Find out what user we're currently logged in as!

## Basic commands to interact with file systems
1. ls = list the files in the current directory
2. cd = change directory
3. cat = output the contents of the file
4. pwd (present working directory) = displays the current directory we are in

## Searching for files / Searching specific contents in the file

  ### find 
  The find command is used to search for specific files in the directory

  **Syntax:**
  
  find -name filename.txt

  **Example 1:**

  **Example 2: **
  
  Using wildcard (*) to find all files with the .txt extension

  ### grep
  The grep command allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for.

  **Syntax:**
  grep "content which we want to find" file name

  **Example:**

  ### Redirection
  redirection operator (>) is used to redirect the output to other location

  **Example:**

  The following code takes the output of printing hey and place it into a file name welcome. If the file is not found in the directory, it will create the file.

  **Example:**

  (>>) is another redirection operator. However, it does not overwrite the contents in the file. It just adds the output at the end.

  ## Flags and switches
  Flags and switches are used to extend the behaviour of commands. The commands usually have additional arguments which perform additional behaviour. These arguments are identified by a hyphen - and followed by the flag/switch keyword.

  Example:
  
  ls -a lists all the available files/folders which includes hidden files/folders

  - To move a file to a new folder, use the mv command.
  - We can also use the mv command to rename a file or folder.

## Common linux directories
