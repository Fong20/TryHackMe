# 08. Linux Fundamentals
directory is also known as a folder

Shortcuts
ctrl L = clear the terminal

## Basic commands
1. echo = Output any text that we provide
2. whoami = Find out what user we're currently logged in as!

## Basic commands to interact with file systems
1. ls = list the files in the current directory
2. cd = change directory
3. cat = output the contents of the file
4. pwd (present working directory) = displays the current directory we are in

## Searching for files / Searching specific contents in the file

  ### find 
  The find command is used to search for specific files in the directory

  **Syntax:**
  
  find -name filename.txt

  **Example 1:**

  **Example 2: **
  
  Using wildcard (*) to find all files with the .txt extension

  ### grep
  The grep command allows us to search the contents of files for specific values that we are looking for.

  **Syntax:**
  grep "content which we want to find" file name

  **Example:**

  ### Redirection
  redirection operator (>) is used to redirect the output to other location

  **Example:**

  The following code takes the output of printing hey and place it into a file name welcome. If the file is not found in the directory, it will create the file.

  **Example:**

  (>>) is another redirection operator. However, it does not overwrite the contents in the file. It just adds the output at the end.

  ## Flags and switches
  Flags and switches are used to extend the behaviour of commands. The commands usually have additional arguments which perform additional behaviour. These arguments are identified by a hyphen - and followed by the flag/switch keyword.

  Example:
  
  ls -a lists all the available files/folders which includes hidden files/folders

  ## Linux filesystem commands
  The following commands allow us to interact with the linux filesystem by:
- creating files and folders
- moving files and folders
- deleting files and folders

  ### Removing file/folder
  - To remove a file, simply use the command rm followed by the name of the file
  - To remove a folder (directory), use the command rm followed by a flag -R followed by the name of the directory

  ### Copying and moving files/folders
  - To copy contents of a file to another file, use the command cp followed by the name of the existing file and the name of the new file which we wish to assign the contents to. Do note that all the contents will be copied.
  - To move a file to a new folder, use the mv command.
  - We can also use the mv command to rename a file or folder.

  ### Determining file type
  To determine the file type, we can use the command file followed by the name of the file

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43a79dd6-5d6b-49d0-bc78-da1986b7797e)

  ### Switching Between Users
  To switch to diffrent users, use the command su followed by the name of the user and enter the user's password

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad918f24-710b-402f-80bc-9439309937f7)

  Simply, by providing the -l switch to su, we start a shell that is much more similar to the actual user logging into the system - we inherit a lot more properties of the new user, i.e., environment variables and the likes.

## Common linux directories
- /etc : root directory which stores all the important system files which are used by the OS
- /var : stores data which are frequently accessed or written by services or applications running on ths system
- /var/log : provides log files from running services and applications
- /tmp : volatile root directory which stores data temporarily. The data stored here will be wiped once the computer is restarted
- /root : Home directory of the root user

## Terminal text editiors
There are two types of text editors:
1. Nano
2. VIM

### Nano
- To create / edit a file using nano text editor, type nano followed by the file's name
- Once information has been provided / edited in the file, remember to save the changes by using ctrl-x

### VIM
VIM is a much more advanced text editor. Whilst you're not expected to know all advanced features, it's helpful to mention it for powering up your Linux skills.

**VIM's benefits:**
- Customisable - you can modify the keyboard shortcuts to be of your choosing
- Syntax Highlighting - this is useful if you are writing or maintaining code, making it a popular choice for software developers
- VIM works on all terminals where nano may not be installed
- There are a lot of resources such as cheatsheets, tutorials, and the sorts available to you use.

## General useful utilities

### Downloading files
Use wget command to downlaod files from the web via HTTP to the directory. This can be done by typing wget followed by the address if the resource that we wish to download.

### Transfering files from host using secure copy (SCP)
Secure copy can be used to copy files and directories from current system to remote system / remote system to current system using SSH protocol to provide both authentication and encryption.

Example:

### Serving files from host using built in Python 3 support
- Ubuntu machines come pre-packaged with Python 3 and Python provides a lightweight solution called HTTPServer which converts the local machine into a quick web server to download your own files.
- The downloaded files will be stored in the directory which is used to run the command.
- To do this, type python3 -m http.server to connect to the server and use the command wget followed by the computer's ip address and name of the file to download the file

## Processes 101
Processes are programs which are running on a system. There are several commands which are used to manipulate system processes

### Viewing system processes
**ps command**
- ps command is used to list down the processes which are running on the computer
- To see processes that don't run from a session (not run by the user), we need to provide aux to the ps command, which looks like this: ps aux

**top command** 
- The top command provides real time statistics about the processes which are running on the system instead of a one time view
- The statistics will refresh every 10 seconds or through arrow key inputs used to browse the rows of statistics.
- Ctrl C needs to be used to exit the terminal once u are done looking at the statistics

### Terminating system processes
- Signals can be used to terminate system processes.
- The general rule of using signal to terminate process is by using the command kill followed by the process identifier. Eg: kill 1337 terminates process identifier 1337

Signals which can be sent to a process when it is killed:
1. SIGTERM = kill the process and perform cleanup process
2. SIGKILL = Kill the process without performing any cleanup
3. SIGSTOP = Stop/Pause the process

### How processes start on linux
- Once a system boots, systemd is one of the first processes which are started and any other programs that we want to start will start as a child process of systemd.
- This means that it is controlled by systemd but will run as its own process (sharing resources with systemd)

### Starting processes/services on boot
- Some applications such as web servers, database servers or file transfer servers are often critical and told to start during the boot up of the system by administrators
- To start applications on boot, use the command systemctl followed by the option and the service. It allows us to interact with the systemd process/daemon

Example: 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f767129a-5586-437c-9aa7-1508e5f6a84a)

systemctl options:
1. Start
2. Stop
3. Enable
4. Disable

### Backgrounding and Foregrounding with Linux
Processes can run in two states, which are background and foreground. 

**Running processes in the background**

In order to run proceses in the background, we can either use & operator or Ctrl Z for script processes

**Advantages of running processes in the background**
1. Clears up terminal
2. Efficiency. Allows us to run other commands while the command is run on the background

**Example: Running echo command in the background using & operator**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/946653ae-5a2d-4fc9-90bd-f221fb2ee194)

**Example: Backgrouding a script process using Ctrl Z**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d97adab0-f72a-426e-a877-2c1f91609a79)

**Returning backgrounded processes to the foreground**
To return backgrounded processes to the foreground, we can use the command fg

## Automation with Linux
Automation can be done on Linux where certain actions or tasks would be scheduled after the system has been booted.

### Crontab command
- Crontab is one of the processes that is started during the boot which is responsible for facillitating and managing cron jobs. It is a special file with formatting that is recognized by the cron process to execute each line step by step.
- Crontabs can be edited by using the command crontab -e where an editor such as nano can be used to edit the crontab
- In order for crontab to work, it needs 6 specific input values as shown below:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20d6f59c-eca0-48f0-a857-5898e8618f2e)

**Example: Backing up files every 12 hours**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac335788-b76e-42d4-b33b-c51a9eaf5faf)

## Managing system logs
- Logs are a great way to monitor the health of the system and protecting it.
- Logs store many different information such as access records, error records, authentication records etc
- System log files can be accessed by accessing the var/log directory (cd var/log). This directory contains files and folders which contain logging information for applications and services running on the system

**Example: Accessing apache2 log files**
