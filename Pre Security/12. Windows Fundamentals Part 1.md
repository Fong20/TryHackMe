## File Systems in Windows

1. **NTFS (New Technology File System):**
   - Default file system for modern Windows versions.
   - **Features:**
     - Journaling: Automatically repairs files/folders after failures using log files.
     - Supports files larger than 4GB.
     - Folder/file permissions.
     - Compression and encryption (via EFS).
   - **Permissions:**
     - Full control, Modify, Read & Execute, List folder contents, Read, Write.
   - **Alternate Data Streams (ADS):**
     - Allows files to have multiple data streams.
     - Often used for metadata; can hide data (used by malware).
     - Can be viewed using PowerShell or third-party tools.

2. **FAT16/FAT32 and HPFS:**
   - **FAT:** Still used in USB devices, MicroSD cards.
   - **HPFS:** A historical predecessor of NTFS.

## User Accounts in Windows

1. **Types of Accounts:**
   - **Administrator:** 
     - Full system-level control.
     - Add/remove users, modify system settings, and install software.
   - **Standard User:** 
     - Limited to personal files/folders.
     - Cannot perform system-level changes.

2. **User Profiles:**
   - Created on first login under `C:\Users\<username>`.
   - Includes default folders like Desktop, Documents, Downloads.

3. **Managing Accounts:**
   - **Local User and Group Management:**
     - Access via `lusrmgr.msc`.
     - Shows Users and Groups with their descriptions and permissions.
     - Users inherit permissions of groups they are part of.
   - **Other User Management:**
     - Add users via Settings > Other users or `lusrmgr.msc`.

4. **Environment Variables:**
   - `%windir%`: Path to the Windows folder.
   - Useful for identifying OS locations regardless of drive/folder.

## Security Features

1. **User Account Control (UAC):**
   - Protects against unauthorized system changes by standard or malicious software.
   - Prompts for admin credentials for elevated actions (e.g., installing software).
   - Shield icon on program icons indicates UAC protection.
   - Does not apply to the built-in Administrator account by default.

2. **System32 Folder:**
   - Contains critical OS files.
   - Modifications can render the system inoperable.

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Use Standard User accounts for daily tasks to minimize risks.
   - Limit use of Administrator privileges to essential tasks.
