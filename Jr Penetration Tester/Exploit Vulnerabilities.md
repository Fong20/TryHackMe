# Exploit Vulnerabilities 

## Purpose
- Learn methods to identify vulnerabilities.
- Explore resources and tools for vulnerability research and exploitation.
- Apply knowledge in a practical challenge.

## Vulnerability Scanning Tools

### Nessus
- Free (community) and commercial editions.
- Commercial edition is used in professional environments.
- TryHackMe offers a dedicated room for learning Nessus.

### Advantages vs Disadvantages of Vulnerability Scanners

| Advantage | Disadvantage |
|----------|--------------|
| Easy to repeat automated scans. | Can lead to over-reliance. |
| Fast and efficient for multiple apps. | Creates heavy traffic/logging (noisy). |
| Open-source solutions available. | Limited features unless upgraded. |
| Broad coverage of vulnerabilities. | May miss specific vulnerabilities. |

### Metasploit
- Contains some vulnerability scanning capabilities.
- More in-depth use covered in later modules.

## Manual Scanning
- Preferred by pentesters for specific applications.
- Involves identifying vulnerabilities like automated scanners.

## Common Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Security Misconfigurations | Leaks due to developer oversight. |
| Broken Access Control | Unauthorized access to application parts. |
| Insecure Deserialization | Execution of malicious code via data handling. |
| Injection | Malicious input due to unsanitized data. |

## Vulnerability Research Databases

### Rapid7
- Acts as both vulnerability and exploit database.
- Includes Metasploit exploit modules and usage instructions.

### GitHub
- Hosts PoCs shared by security researchers.
- Useful for fresh and rare exploits.
- Searchable by keywords like "PoC", "vulnerability", and "CVE".
- Risk: PoCs may lack support or not work.

## Tools

### Searchsploit
- Offline copy of Exploit-DB.
- Available on Kali Linux and TryHackMe AttackBox.
- Search examples:
  ```
  searchsploit wordpress
  ```

## Exploiting Vulnerabilities

### Remote Code Execution Example

#### Modify Exploit Script
```python
# Before
mymachine="192.168.1.10"
port="1337"

# After
mymachine="10.13.37.10"
port="1337"
```

#### Running the Exploit
- Show current user:
  ```
  exploit.py -u http://10.10.10.10 -c "whoami"
  Output: www-data
  ```
- Read a file:
  ```
  exploit.py -u http://10.10.10.10 -c "cat flag.txt"
  Output: THM{EXPLOIT_COMPLETE}
  ```

## Conclusion
- Exploits need customization for each environment.
- Choosing the right exploit and modifying it appropriately is critical for success.
